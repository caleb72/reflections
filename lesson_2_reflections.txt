Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

R: Initialising repositories set up a folder so that git can interact with it. Without it Git will just treat it like an ordinary folder of files.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

R: The staging area prepares files for a single commit. This allows you to control what changes/files actually needs to be in a single commit to the repository.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

R: You can always run "git diff --staged" to find out what changes are in the staging area so you can be sure that you've only added the changes you want to before creating a commit.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

R: When you want to start a new piece of work that might take a while and your master branch is still required for main fixes. If the work you need to do needs to be done in parallel to a main branch.
